synopsis: "A datastructure to accumulate values in bins"
description: """

This library is useful for counting elements by categories,
constructing relations and transposing them. Binning are constructed
from streams of values. A binning can be seen as a generalized
histogram: values are mapped to bins, and each bin keeps a summary
value that is updated when an element is added (like a count, the list
of elements, their mean, etc)."""
