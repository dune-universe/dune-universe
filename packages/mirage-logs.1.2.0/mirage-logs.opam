synopsis: "A reporter for the Logs library that writes log messages to stderr, using a Mirage `CLOCK` to add timestamps"
description: """
It can also log only important messages to the console, while writing all received messages to a ring buffer which is displayed if an exception occurs.

If tracing is enabled (via mirage-profile), it also writes each log message to the trace buffer.
