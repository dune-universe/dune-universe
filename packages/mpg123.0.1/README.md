This is an OCaml package that provides bindings to the mpg123 library.

It uses the excellent ctypes library to generate the C-stubs which should help
minimize the bugspace.

Installing
===

`opam install mpg123`

Status
===

There's just enough here to open an mp3, query some metadata, and read audio.

Contributions welcome.
