synopsis: "A ppx rewriter that transforms a recursive module expression into a `struct`"
description: """
In a recursive module expression, the struct can be derived from the signature automatically
by the compiler. This package does the same thing, but doing it this way allows ppx_deriving
to transform the signature and struct separately.
