synopsis: "A non empty list library for OCaml"
description: """
A list that is known, statically, to be nonempty. 
The hd and tl functions don't require option types, or exceptions, improving safety.  

This library follows closely Janestreet's Base library,
providing similar complexity and functions to Base.List.
