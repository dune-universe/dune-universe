# Gopcaml Changelog

- Version 0.0.3 - Polishing release
  - *Added support for customisable verbosity*
    - Customise the Emacs variable `gopcaml-messaging-level` to change
      the level of messages that are output by GopCaml. Set it to
      `'none` to disable messages entirely.
  - *Fixed bug when starting zipper mode at the start of a file.*
    - Zipper mode selects the immediately prior byte position to avoid
      inconsistencies when the cursor is just on the edge of an
      expression, but when the cursor is at position 1, this causes an
      error as 0 is not a valid point.
  - *Special casing of shebangs*
    - Added support for handling shebangs at the start of a buffer.
    - Implemented as part of a larger library for preprocessing buffer
      text before running the parser on it - could be extended to
      support additional preprocessing in the future.
    - Another possible direction for extension is to use an Emacs
      callback to modify the text, although this may not be ideal, as
      the parsing has to be as fast as possible.

- Version 0.0.2 - Unicode-lovers & Refactoring release
  - *Updated to work with OCaml 4.12.0*
    - Updated to depend on ocaml-migrate-parsetree, back-porting support back to OCaml.4.08.0+
  - *Improved support for jumping to nearest pattern*
    - Pressing C-c C-p will now jump to the nearest enclosing wildcard or pattern if no wildcard exists
    - C-c C-o operates as normal for jumping to the nearest let definition
  - *Added support for moving within patterns*
  - *Added support for moving within types*
  - *improved quality of main Ast_zipper code*
    - more comments
    - refactoring TextRegion module to a separate file so it may be
      reused for other analyses
  - *Added support for excluding files*
    - Now does not complain when opening ocamllex or menhir files
    - see `gopcaml-ignored-extensions` variable for more information
  - *Fixed ordering of parameters when using optional arguments*
    - previously optional arguments would appear before their bindings
  - *Added better support for multi-byte strings*
    - previously, use of multi-byte strings would cause overlays to
      desynchronise with the code
    - the OCaml parser represents offsets and ranges in terms of byte
      offsets, while the conversion functions being used in the
      program (Position.of_int_exn) assumed they were code points
    - the existing code would function correctly on buffers using only
      single-byte characters, but would fail on buffers with
      multi-byte buffers
    - now our unicode using foriegn-language friends can too enjoy the
      power of Gopcaml mode!
  - *Fixed bug with transpose expression*

- Version 0.0.1 - Initial release
