description: """
     Provides deserialisation of logging configuration 
(loggers instantation and handlers parameters) from json,
using ppx_deriving_yojson.

-------

     Logging infrastructure inspired by the Python logging module.
The aim of this module is to provide a quick and easy to use logging
infrastructure.

It has the following features :
   * one line logger creation
   * log messages are either [string] or [string lazy_t]
   * log level adaptable at runtime from anywhere in the program
   * handlers associated to each logger will format and treat the message independantly.
   * annotage log messages with tags
