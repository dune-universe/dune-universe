    --verbose                     Turn on verbose mode.
    --file FILE                   Filename of input data. Only numerical values are supported.
    --treetype TYPE               Set tree type to:
                                  TYPE = 1: Classification.
                                  TYPE = 3: Regression.
                                  TYPE = 5: Survival.
                                  (Default: 1)
    --probability                 Grow a Classification forest with probability estimation for the classes.
                                  Use in combination with --treetype 1.
    --depvarname NAME             Name of dependent variable. For survival trees this is the time variable.
    --statusvarname NAME          Name of status variable, only applicable for survival trees.
                                  Coding is 1 for event and 0 for censored.
    --ntree N                     Set number of trees to N.
                                  (Default: 500)
    --mtry N                      Number of variables to possibly split at in each node.
                                  (Default: sqrt(p) with p = number of independent variables)
    --targetpartitionsize N       Set minimal node size to N.
                                  For Classification and Regression growing is stopped if a node reaches a size smaller than N.
                                  For Survival growing is stopped if one child would reach a size smaller than N.
                                  This means nodes with size smaller N can occur for Classification and Regression.

    --predall                     Return a matrix with individual predictions for each tree instead of aggregated 
                                  predictions for all trees (classification and regression only).

                                  (Default: 1)
    --impmeasure TYPE             Set importance mode to:

                                  TYPE = 3: Permutation importance, no scaling.
                                  TYPE = 5: Corrected node impurity: Bias-corrected version of node impurity importance.
