synopsis: "Unix errno types, maps, and support"
description: """\
unix-errno can be used with or without ctypes and OCaml's Unix
module. Without ctypes and Unix, the basic types and functions are
provided as well as Errno_host containing errno maps for popular
operating systems. The errno-srcgen tool for generating OCaml source
representing Errno.Host.t values will also be built. With ctypes and
Unix, you'll also receive the errno-map tool for outputting the current
host's errno map and the Errno_unix module containing an errno global
variable checking function and Unix.error type converters."""
