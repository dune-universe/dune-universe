About:
------

  Anthill has two main aims:

  1. As a shell to perform quick word searches (build, anagram and pattern),
  mostly duplicating the functionality of the late lamented Lexpert
  [http://www.valuecube.com/lexpert/].

  2. To explore the idea of a language to perform complex word queries, somewhat
  akin to zyzzyva [http://www.zyzzyva.net], but based on scripts rather than a GUI

  Ideally, I would like to achieve feature parity with nutrimatic [http://nutrimatic.org/]

Features:
---------

  * Anagram
  * Build
  * Pattern
  * Single character wildcard (.)
  * Multi character wildcard (*)
  * Character class wildcard ([abc] matches a, b or c)
  * Basic set operations (and, or, diff)

Examples:
---------

  * Find all the anagrams of RETINAS

  anagram > retinas  <-- note that we are in anagram mode by default
  anestri
  antsier
  nastier
  ratines
  resiant
  retains
  retinas
  retsina
  stainer
  starnie
  stearin

  * AEIDCST + ? = 
  anagram > aeidcst.
  acidiest
  acridest
  cadgiest
  citadels
  danciest
  dialects
  dictates
  distance
  misacted
  scaithed
  spicated

  * How many words start with A and end with B?
  anagram > p a*b
  ab
  abb
  abcoulomb
  absorb
  acerb
  adsorb
  adverb
  aerobomb
  alb
  aldicarb
  antisnob
  aplomb
  arb
  ardeb
  athrob
