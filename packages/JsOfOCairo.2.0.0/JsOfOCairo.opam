description: """
JsOfOCairo is an OCaml (4.02.3+) library to reuse Cairo-based drawing code in web browsers.
It's an adapter, implementing (a reasonable subset of) the interface of [Cairo OCaml](https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo/)
targeting HTML5 canvas elements as exposed to OCaml by [js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/) (3.0.0+)."""
