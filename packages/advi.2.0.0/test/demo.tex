\subsection* {Images in presentations}

{\ActiveDVI} supports \verb+\includegraphics+ with native image formats.

\subsection* {EPS (and other!) graphics inclusion using Camlimages}
\begin{quote}
\verb+\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{caml.eps}+\\
\verb+\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{caml.eps}+\\
\verb+\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{world}+\\

This last command looks for a file named {\tt world} with extensions
out of the ones provided by the directive
\verb+\DeclareGraphicsExtensions+ in the \verb|advi-graphicx| package.
In the present case, it finds \verb+world.jpg+, for which a
bounding box specification must be available in the file
\verb+world.bb+. For this image \verb+world.bb+ is:
\begin{verbatim}
%%BoundingBox: 15 208 580 633
\end{verbatim}

\medskip

\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{../tex/caml.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth,height=0.09\textwidth]{../tex/caml.eps}
\framebox{\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{world}}
\end{quote}

\newpage

\subsection* {Other eye candies for presentation}

\medskip\noindent
\docdef \adviwait\docopt{seconds}
\begin{quote}
Wait for \docid{seconds} or wait for ever if no argument is
provided. Wait means do nothing until the user requests to
continue (or to move to another page).
\end{quote}

\medskip\noindent
\docdef \advirecord \doctt{[play]}\docarg{tag}\docarg{latex code}
\begin{quote}
Computes \docid{latex code} and records its DVI output bound to the tag
\docid{tag}. The DVI output is not displayed during recording, unless the
option \doctt{play} is set.

Embedded recordings are prohibited. 
\end{quote}

\medskip\noindent
\docdef \adviplay\docopt{color}\docarg{tag}
\begin{quote}
Replay the DVI previously recorded as \docid{tag}.
The optional argument changes the color to \docid{color} during replay. 
\end{quote}

\newpage

\subsection* {Eye candies (examples)}

\begin{itemize}
   \item mark the text with a tag name:\\
     $\tt \backslash advirecord\{this\}
      \{\advirecord[play]{this}{Warning~to~the~casual~user}\}$

   \item then change the current text color and replay the tagged text:\\
  $\tt{\backslash}adviplay\{this\}$.
\end{itemize}


\noindent
For instance, to display in red the text associated to the tag
{\tt this} above, you can either pass a color option to the play command:
\verb+\adviplay[red]{this}}+\\
\advirecord[play]{that}{\goon}\adviwait%
\textcolor {c1}{\adviplay {this}\adviplay {that}}\adviwait
{\adviplay{this}\adviplay {that}}\adviwait

\noindent
or place the command in the appropriate color environment:
to display the same text in green, type\\
\verb+\textcolor{green}{\adviplay{this}}+\\
\advirecord[play]{goon}{\goon}\adviwait
\textcolor{green}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}\adviwait}

\noindent
Using pauses and color settings, you can get
\advirecord[play]{this}{various}
\textcolor{red}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{color (and fonts)}
\textcolor{c2}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{effects}
\textcolor{c3}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{in}
\textcolor{c4}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{your}
\textcolor{c5}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{texts}
\textcolor{c6}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
\advirecord[play]{this}{!}\\
\textcolor{red}{\adviplay{this}\adviplay{goon}}\adviwait
Including some strange flashing effect!

\subsection* {Launching applications}

Any Unix command can be launch during the presentation.
This is convenient to call an external program to draw material in the
{\ActiveDVI} window, or to start a demo from within the presentation.

\bigskip

\noindent
To launch the program {\verb"command"} use in your {\LaTeX} source file\\

\verb+\adviembed{command}+\\

\noindent Additionnally, you may precise the size of the rectangular
window where the application will draw its material. {\ActiveDVI} will
reserve that area for your application.\\

\verb+\adviembed[width=w,height=h]{command}+\\

\noindent
Moreover, {\ActiveDVI} provides two special \TeX macros \verb"@g" and
\verb"@p" that specify the geometry and the (X) window identifier that
the application should use. Hence, if {\verb"command"} has option
{\tt -geometry} to specify its X geometry specification, and option
{\verb"-use"} to specify the X window it should use, then\\

\verb+\adviembed[width=w,height=h]{command -geometry @g -use @p}+\\

\noindent will launch \verb"command" with a geometry computed from the
width and height specifications of the \verb|adviembed| call (the
specified \verb"w" and \verb"h" parameters); hence the system command
\verb"command" will run in the (X) window \verb"@p" (normally a
sub-window of {\ActiveDVI}'s window) with the proper geometry.

\newpage

\subsection* {Embedding applications}

There are two kinds of applications you can launch during the
presentation:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\em embeddable applications} that run inside a subwindow of the
main {\ActiveDVI}'s window (hence their window is stuck to the precise
place computed for you by {\ActiveDVI}),

\item {\em non-embeddable applications} that run in a window of their
own (hence their window is unrelated to the {\ActiveDVI}'s window and
may be moved independantly).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Embeddable applications}

For each application to launch, {\ActiveDVI} allocates a new sub
window of the specified size.  If provided, the identifier \verb"@p"
is replaced by the (X) identifier of that sub window, in order for the
application to use that sub window as its root window. Options to
specify the root window may vary according to the application at hand
(however, \verb"-use" or \verb"-window" are common to specify this
option). Unfortunately, not every X-application is capable of using a
specified window as its (root) window.  If an application can be
rerooted, it is truely embeddable into {\ActiveDVI} (meaning it is
really a part of the {\ActiveDVI} window). Otherwise the application
is not embeddable.

\subsubsection*{Non embeddable applications}

If the application cannot be rerooted (or if the \verb"@p" parameter
is not specified), {\ActiveDVI} cannot control the placement of the
application: the window manager will handle it. However, {\ActiveDVI}
helps by providing a complete X geometry specification: with width and
height, an extra \verb"+x+y" shift is indicated to precisely access
the place where the embedding should occur in the {\ActiveDVI}
window. Hence, the application appears at the right place even if it
cannot be rerooted and is indeed impossible to embed.

\newpage

\subsubsection*{Launching embeddable applications}

Rerootable applications obey to the X geometry specifications and thus
can be properly displayed within the {\ActiveDVI} window (embedding).

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \verb"display" command (from ImageMagick) can show any image into your
presentation using:\\
\verb|\adviembed[width=3cm,height=3.3cm]|\\
\verb|          {display -geometry @g! -window @p logo.gif}|\\
\adviembed[ephemeral=advilogo,width=3cm, height=3.3260869cm]{display -geometry @g! -window @p advilogo.gif}

\item Similarly, \verb|animate| can display animations with:\\
        \verb|\adviembed[width=2cm,height=2cm]|\\
        \verb|          {animate -geometry @g! -window @p anim.gif}|\\
        \adviembed[ephemeral=animate,width=2cm,height=2cm]{animate -geometry @g! -window @p mmm.anim.gif}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection*{Launching embeddable applications (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Any application which supports embedding options can be launched, as\\
   \verb+\adviembed[width=w,height=h]{prog -geometry @g -use @p}+\\
   For instance, using wish:\\
   \verb|\adviembed[persistent,width=5cm,height=1cm]|\\
   \verb|          {wish ./watch -geometry @g -use @p}|\\
   \adviembed[persistent=wish,width=5cm,height=0.71cm]{wish ./watch -geometry @g -use @p}
\adviwait
  \item Possibly interactive ! (We use CamlTk here)\\
   \verb|\adviembed[persistent=taquin,width=6.5cm,height=9.5cm]|\\
   \verb|          {./taquin -geometry @g -use @p dojoji.gif}|\\
  \adviembed[persistent=taquin,width=8.5cm,height=10cm]{./taquin.sh -geometry @g -use @p dojoji.gif}

\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection*{Launching non-embeddable applications}

If an X application does not support the specification of its parent
window, it will be automatically handled by the window manager. Then,
depending on the WM at hand, the placements may or may not obey your
geometry specifications. (In some cases, disabling the ``remember window
positions'' option of your WM may help.)

Applications launched that way will not be properly embedded: they
will appear {\em above} not {\em inside} the {\ActiveDVI}
window. (Hence if you move the {\ActiveDVI} window the applications
will not follow (they may even desappear {\em below} the
{\ActiveDVI}'s window)).

\begin{itemize}
 \item Xeyes using the macro command \verb|embed|:\\
   \verb|\adviembed[width=2cm,height=2cm]|\\
   \verb|    {xeyes -bw 0 -shape -geometry @g}|\\
   \adviembed[width=2cm,height=2cm]{xeyes -bw 0 -shape -geometry @g}

 \item An Xterm running an interesting application:\\
   \verb|\adviembed[width=10cm,height=4cm]|\\
   \verb|    {xterm -geometry 50x7+@x+@y -e ocaml}|\\
% Ne marche pas car la géometrie de xterm est en caractères non en points
%   \adviembed[width=10cm,height=4cm]{xterm -geometry @g -e ocaml}
   \adviembed[width=0.1\textwidth,height=0.02\textheight]{xterm -geometry @g -e ocaml}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection* {Launching non-embeddable applications (cont.)}

You can add music to your presentation, if you have a music
player available: just embed the music player at the precise place
where you want it to play your sounds.

  \verb|\adviembed[width=1mm,height=1mm]|\\
  \verb|    {mpg123 -q music.mp3}|

\advirecord{play}
 {\adviembed[name=mpg123,width=1mm,height=1mm]{mpg123 -q music.mp3}}
\advirecord{stop}
 {\advikillembed{mpg123}}

\advianchor[click]{play}{Play}
\advianchor[click]{stop}{Stop}

\medskip
\noindent
Here, we added active buttons to start and stop the music (don't forget
to add that kind of gadgets in your shows: it can be very frustrating to have
music automatically launched when you are still speaking! :)

\bigskip

\noindent
In conclusion, the \verb|embed| macro can launch any executable
command during your presentations.

\newpage

\section* {Postscript specials}

{\ActiveDVI} recognizes and renders Postscript Specials by calling and telling
\verb"ghostview" to display Postscript on the \verb"advi" window. 
Hence, images drawn using PS tricks will be displayed by \verb"advi". 
However, PS tricks make the assumptions that everything is displayed
by Postscript, which is wrong since \verb"advi" displays most of the
material itself.

\subsubsection* {Most PS-tricks do work}
\begin {itemize}

\item[+]
Simple drawings, such as \verb"\psframe", \verb"\ovalnode", \ldots.
\begin{quote}
\ovalnode{A}{oval} \hspace {4em}
\Rnode{R}{\psframebox{rectangle}}\pnode{right}
\end{quote}

\item[+]
Connections between nodes {\tt \string \ncarc}, {\tt \string \ncarc},
also works.
\ncarc{->}{A}{R}

\item[+]
Labels over arrows \verb"\Aput", \verb"\Bput", etc.
\Bput{\rnode{L}{label}}

\item[+] 
{\tt\string\SpecialCoor}, {\em i.e.} commands of the form
{\tt \string \rput (A)\{bla bla\}} works where {\tt A} is a node name. 
\SpecialCoor
\rput[b](right){\rlap{\em right of rectangle}}
(Of course rotations of text do not work.)
\end {itemize}

\subsubsection*{Limitations of Postscript specials}

Unfortunately, some PS-tricks may not work. 
Known limitations are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] {\ActiveDVI} only recognizes binary overlays (display if 0,
hide otherwise). This is sufficient for the prosper documentclass (see
\hyperlink {overlays}{below}).

\end {itemize}

\subsubsection*{Known bug with PS tricks}

With some old versions of \verb"gs" and/or \verb"X11", the PS tricks are not
correctly synchronized. Some drawings may hide text, or conversely.

% Examples: 
% \Rnode {A}{A} \qquad \Rnode {B}{B}
% \ncline{->}{A}{B} \Aput{L}

\newpage

\section* {Overlays}
\hypertarget {overlays}{}

Overlays of the \verb"seminar" mode uses PS tricks, but in a manner that
requires characters to be also printed as Postscript. The \verb"advi" package 
redefines \verb"\overlay" so that it draws only the first overlay (and
ignore others).
Hence, \verb"advi" cannot be used to preview slides using \verb"seminar"
overlays. However, a better package for overlays (build on top of seminar)
is \verb"prosper", which only uses the ability to show or hide some
material, which works well with \verb"advi".

Some reimplementation of \verb"\overlay" for \verb"advi" to work with 
seminar overlays might still be possible...  

\newpage

\section* {Printing your slides: the ignore mode}

The package \verb"advi" can be loaded with the \verb"ignore" option:

\smallskip
{\verb"\usepackage[ignore]{advi}"}
\smallskip

\noindent
The effect is to switch off some \verb"advi" gadgets and to render some others 
in Postscript, if possible. This is useful to generate a DVI file that
can be easily turned into Postscript to print a set of slides as an
approximation of the show that {\ActiveDVI} plays.

\newpage

\section* {Hyper links to other files}

\begin {itemize}

\item (Recursive) link to \hyperref{demo.dvi}{}{overlays}{\tt demo.dvi}
is produced by

\qquad\verb"\hyperref{demo.dvi}{}{overlays}{\tt demo.dvi}"

A click opens file \verb"demo.dvi" with a new \verb"advi" process and
jumps to the link \verb"overlays" in that file, as if the command

\qquad\verb"advi -html overlays demo.dvi"

had been typed in a shell.

\item The source file of this demo is \hyperref{demo.tex}{}{}{\tt
demo.tex}. A link to the source file is produced by

\qquad\verb"\hyperref{demo.tex}{}{}{\tt more demo.tex}"

A click on the link opens the file in a new window, as if 

\qquad\verb"more demo.tex"

had been typed in a shell.

\item Currently, the file is recognized from its file name extension
that must be one of \verb".dvi", \verb".pdf", \verb".ps", \verb".eps",
\verb".htm", or \verb".html". In addition various well-known text file
extensions are recognized, namely \verb".txt", \verb".tex",
\verb".ftex", \verb".sty", \verb".pic", and famous programming
languages source file extensions such as \verb".scm", \verb".c",
\verb".el", or \verb".ml". In the future, this feature should use Mine
man Mailcap to find the type of the file and the proper previewer for
that file.

For the time being, the viewer commands can be set using an
option on the command line (or including this option in the
\verb".advirc" file). Options are \verb"-browser", \verb"-pager",
\verb"-pdf-viewer", \verb"-ps-viewer".

\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section* {Hyper links to other files (cont)}

For instance, you can compare the rendering of \ActiveDVI's manual

\begin{itemize}

\item in PDF, viewing {\tt ../doc/manual.pdf} with the
\hyperref{../doc/manual.pdf}{}{}{viewer for PDF} files (by default
{\tt xpdf}),
\item in PostScript, viewing {\tt ../doc/manual.ps} with the
\hyperref{../doc/manual.ps}{}{}{viewer for PostScript} files (by
default {\tt gv}),
\item in DVI, \hyperref{../doc/manual.dvi}{}{}{as rendered by
\ActiveDVI}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection *{Wrong links}

In case of bad link, {\ActiveDVI} just ignores the link and emits an
error a warning is emitted on standard error (Unix {\tt stderr}). For
instance

\begin{itemize}

\item when the file extension is not recognized:

\hyperref{bad-talk.ppt}{}{}{\tt bad-talk.ptt}

\item or the file is non-existent:

\hyperref{nonexistent.dvi}{}{}{\tt nonexistent.dvi}

\end {itemize}

\newpage

\subsection* {Combination of replays and PS tricks}

Replay command can hide or show text or change the color of text. 
However, Postscript colors are hard-wired by {\TeX}, {\em i.e.} they are not
interpreted in the current color context as font colors are.
\noindent
Replay can still be used to simulate the replay of Postscript colors:
it suffices to superpose two identical figures. For instance, 
$$
\psset {linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid}
\rlap
{\advirecord{tagb}{\ovalnode [fillcolor=green]{A}{\textbf {Postscript}}}}%
\advirecord[play]{taga}{\ovalnode [fillcolor=yellow]{B}{\textbf {Postscript}}}
$$
will  be rendered by
\begin{verbatim}
  \psset {linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid}
  \def \PS {\textbf {Postscript}}
  \rlap {\advirecord{tagb}{\ovalnode [fillcolor=green]{A}{\PS}}}%
  \advirecord[play]{taga}{\ovalnode [fillcolor=yellow]{B}{\PS}}}
\end{verbatim}
\begin {enumerate}

\item Type space to change the text color. 
\adviwait\textcolor{red}{\adviplay{taga}}
\begin{verbatim}
    \textcolor{red}{\adviplay{taga}}
\end{verbatim}

\item Type space to change the background.
\adviwait\textcolor{red}{\adviplay{tagb}}
\begin{verbatim}
    \textcolor{red}{\adviplay{tagb}}
\end{verbatim}

\end {enumerate}

\newpage

\subsection*{Active anchors}

Active anchors are much alike HTML anchors, except that instead of
jumping to a reference anchors (usually another page), they 
replay a recorded piece of DVI when the mouse is over the
anchor area. The page is saved and reset to its normal shape when the mouse
leaves the anchor region.

\noindent
Scratch those stamps with the mouse to see how much you win \verb":)"

$$
\ovalnode [linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=yellow]{A}
  {\advirecord {A}{\textbf {10000}}}
\advianchor{A}{\adviplay[yellow]{A}}
\hspace {4em}
\def \i{\textcolor{green}{.}}
\ovalnode [linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=green]{B}
  {\advirecord {B}{\i\textbf{Lost}!\i}}
\advianchor{B}{\adviplay[green]{B}}
$$
The left game was typeset as
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
\ovalnode [linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=yellow]{A}
  {\advirecord {A}{\textbf {10000}}}
\advianchor{A}{\adviplay[yellow]{A}}
\end{verbatim}}%

\medskip
\noindent
The effect of active anchors can also be 
\advianchor{C}{delocalized}.
\SpecialCoor
\advirecord {C}
  {\ncarc[linecolor=red,arcangleA=50,arcangleB=50,linewidth=3pt]
         {<->}{A}{B}\Aput{\color{blue}{\huge{\bf Fire!}}}
}
\begin{verbatim}
\SpecialCoor
\advirecord {C}
  {\ncarc[linecolor=red,
          arcangleA=50,arcangleB=50,linewidth=3pt]
         {<->}{A}{B}\Aput{\color{blue}{\huge{\bf Fire!}}}
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Another form of%
\begin{superpose}
\advirecord[play]{a1}{\advianchor{a2}{ simple }}\\
\advirecord{a2}{\adviplay[white]{a1}\colorbox{yellow}{ cool }}
\end{superpose}%
annotations is the overriding of%
\begin{superpose}
\advianchor{7}{ words. }\\
\advirecord{7}{\adviplay[white]{6}\colorbox{white}{{ text. }}}\\
\end{superpose}

\noindent
You can also replace larger pieces of text by other%
\begin{superpose}
\advirecord[play]{1}{\advianchor{2}{pieces} of \advianchor{3}{text}}\\
\advirecord{2}{\colorbox{white}{\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}

\advirecord{3}{\colorbox{white}{The \qquad End.}}\\
\end{superpose}

\newpage

\subsection*{\adviannot{Active Annotations}(2,1.5){Annotations \\are great!}}

\noindent
\adviannot[p=9em]{Active anchors}(1,1.5)
{\centering Active anchors are even greater!}
can also annotate text as \adviannot[C,bg=green]{here}{here=h+e+r+e},
{\adviannot[c]{for instance}(-1.5,1){\textcolor{red}{for example ?}}}.

\medskip

\noindent

Background of annotations defaults to yellow, centering annotation is
reminiscent to the {\tt array} command: {\tt c} means centered,
{\tt r} right ajusted, and {\tt l} left adjusted. Uppercase variants
{\tt C}, {\tt L}, {\tt R}, have the same meaning, plus implicit math
mode environment.

some macros. The package \verb"advi-annot" is necessary to get
the annotation macros.

\subsection*{Superpose Package}

This very small package provides superimposition of boxes, making the
surrounding box large enough to fit all the included boxes. This is convenient
when displaying each included box at different pauses.

\subsection*{Pictures for \TeX}

{\ActiveDVI} can display pictures for \TeX, as generated by
the \verb"gpic" command into a list of \TeX~ \verb"\special" commands.

\bigskip

To obtain a figure, you first write commands for the language
{\em pic} into a file; from this pic file, you can generate a \TeX
file using a {\em pic compiler}, e.g. \verb"gpic"; then include this
compiled file into your presentation, and {\ActiveDVI} will nicely display it.

Let's consider the \verb"pic" source file \verb"trigo.pic" given
\hyperref{trigo_source.dvi}{}{}{here}; we obtain
\verb"trigo.tex" using the command 
\begin{verbatim}
gpic -t trigo.pic > trigo.tex
\end{verbatim}

Then we include \verb"trigo.tex" with the \TeX command
\verb|\input{trigo}| and get:

\def\showgraph{%
  \par\medskip\centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}\bigskip\noindent\ignorespaces}

\input{trigo}

See the \verb"gpic" command manual for more information about
\verb"gpic" and the programming language \verb"pic".
