We suppose that the executables are acgc and acg (they could have been
acgc.opt or acg.opt)

This directory provide the following files:

+ strings.acg : a file containing a very simple signature (with
definitions). You can use it as follows:

	acgc strings.acg

It will say that it correctly parse the file. You can also run:

	acgc -i strings.acg

then, on the prompt, enter the following term:
	every + dog ! chases + a + cat : string
it does not complain, or the term:
	lambda x. every + x : string -> string
But with the term:
	lambda x.every x : string -> string
you will have a typing error


+ montague.acg : a file containing a very simple signature that illustrates
(very basic) Montague semantics


+ montague-script : a file providing commands that you can run in acg.	
You can also run it with the following command:	
	
	acg montague-script

(press return after each command)

+ tag.acg : a file containing various signatures and lexicons to model
TAG in ACG. You can run acgc on it




+ tag-script : this file provides (commented) commands that you can run
in acg. You can also run it with the following command:

	acg tag-script

(press return after each command)
