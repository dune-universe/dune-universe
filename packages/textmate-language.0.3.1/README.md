# ocaml-textmate-language

`textmate-language` provides functions for reading TextMate grammars and
tokenizing lines of source code. It is useful for syntax highlighting, but
does not provide any functions for assigning visual styles to tokens.

`textmate-language` follows SemVer. It is currently in 0.Y.z, so Y will be
incremented for breaking changes.
