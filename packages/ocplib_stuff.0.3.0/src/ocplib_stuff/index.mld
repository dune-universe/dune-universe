{1 Library ocplib_stuff}

This library contains some basic stuff that is used in some OCP libraries 
and applications. Most of them are probably available in other extensions
of the standard libraries (extlib, core, etc.), but we are used to these
ones.


This library exposes the following toplevel modules:
{!modules:EzArray EzBytes EzCompat.3_12_1 EzCompat.4_02_0 EzCompat.4_03_0 EzList EzString MinUnix}
