(** Rabin's fingerprint and diff algorithm.

    Let's take a random buffer [a]. We can produce from it an {i index} which is
    a (lightweight) simple table of occurences ([string]) found into [a].

    From this {i index}, we can get a {i diff} with another random buffer [b]
    such as:

    {[
      let index = make a in
      let diff = delta index ~source:a ~target:b in
      assert (apply a diff = b)
    ]}

    A {i diff} is a list of {!hunk}. [apply] is a simple function which needs
    the source [a] to reconstruct [b]. *)

  | Insert of (int * int)
