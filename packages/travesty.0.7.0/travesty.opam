synopsis: "Traversable containers, monad extensions, and more"
description: """
'Travesty' is a library for defining containers with applicative
or monadic traversals, inspired by Haskell's Traversable typeclass; it also
contains various helpers for monadic code, such as state transformers and
extension functions for common monads and containers.  It sits on top of Jane
Street's Base library and ecosystem."""
