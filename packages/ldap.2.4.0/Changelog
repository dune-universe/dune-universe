2.4.0
    * Switched from OASIS to dune
    * ocamldap is now a meta-package in opam that pulls a newly created ldap package.
2.3.0
    * Enable OCaml >= 4.02 compatibility
    * Enable safe-string compatibility
    * Backport fixes from 2.1.8
    * Use OASIS to build the documentation
    * Bug fixed: Ldap_protocol doesn't handle SASL correctly (RFC 4511 4.2.2)
      (Patch by David Allsopp)
    * Added paged result control
      (Patch by Christian Wills)
    * Fix: Add Str to the build dependencies
2.2
    * OCaml 4 compatibility
    * Modularize the library in sub-libraries: ldap ldap.ldif ldap.toplevel
    * Use oasis
    * Repository cleaning
    * Maintainer changed
    * Switch from svn to git
2.1.8
    * Fix (See c89bddc)
2.1.7
    * Fixed a bug in search_a, if a search results in zero results an
    exception (LDAP_Failure (`SUCCESS, ..)) was being raised by the
    search_a function instead of by the closure which it returnes.
    2.1.7 handles this case correctly, the exception is only raised by
    the closure which is returned.
2.1.6
    * Fixed a bug in the filter parser, it was rejecting
    filters of the form uid=cn=... which are valid filters.
    * fixed several bugs in the output of ldif change records
    * Ldap_ooclient.fold now runs in constant stack space
    in the presence of arbitrarially complex exception
    handlers.
    * Ldap_ooclient.ldapcon.search_a makes an effort to
    detect if the server is really still there before
    returning the cursor function.
    It does this by trying to download the first object.
    This should eliminate errors when starting an async
    search with a connection which has timed out (it
    will now reconnect automatically).
    * Ldap_ooclient.ldapcon.search_a, the cursor now does a
    reconnect when the operation is abandoned. This clears
    a lot of common problems, however one gotcha is that
    all currently active async operations will be ended if
    one of them abandons. This is usually not a problem
    however, since an abandon is almost always caused
    by a serious error.
2.1.5
    * Fixed a bug in the delete method of ldapentry, it would not
    correctly process a list of deleteions in a certian case
    * Added two new functions to ldif_oo, read_ldif_file, and
    write_ldif_file. The former reads all the entries in an ldif file
    into a list of entries, while the latter writes all the entries in
    the given list to an ldif file.
    * Added an object locking table to ldap_mutex, which allows
    individual objects to be locked (advisory locking like POSIX flock)
    * Applied a patch which makes the toplevel printers to pass all
    data through String.escaped, and which adds a close bracket which
    was missing in some cases.Thanks to Victor Seletsky for this patch.
    * Changed the toplevel printer to print a max of 50 entries, to
    avoid overwhelming emacs. At some point I want to make this
    configurable.
    * Added a function to return the canonical dn to Ldap_dn.
    * Improved (drastically) the ldap_strerror, and ldap_perror functions,
    they now print out something which looks exactly like the string
    representation of an LDAP_Failure exception in the toplevel. Avid users
    of the toplevel will hopefully appreciate this as much as I do.
2.1.4
    * Changed the type of the result of the low level ldif parser
    (Ldif_parser) to produce search_result_entry instead of its own
    type. This allows better cross module communication, and simplified
    the Ldif_oo module's job a bit.
    * Fixed a bug in the ldif pretty printer. It would print values
    containing only white space, or with leading white space
    without base64 encoding them, this is an error.
    * 2.5x decoder speedup. (4.0 MB/s sustained on an 800Mhz G4). The
    bytecode decoder is now 10% faster than the original native code
    compiled decoder released in 2.0, and it is 14 times faster than
    Perl's Net::LDAP library.
    * Fixed a bug in the ssl readbyte implementation which could
    cause data loss to occurr if peeking very far ahead.
    * The print method of ldapentry is now deprecated
2.1.3
    * Added toplevel pretty printers for Oid.t, Lcstring.t,
    and ldapentry_t
    * fixed in readbyte_of_fd, upon reading the C code for this
    function I realized that under some conditions
    Unix.in_channel_of_fd may fail.
    I was not aware of this previously. We now catch the
    resulting Sys_error, and change it to a Transport_error.
    It is very unlikely that this would ever happen.
    * Added a parser and pretty printer for extended ldif as used
    by openldap. ldif change records can now be read and written
    from and to nice data structures. I implemented this because
    I needed to read replogs from slurpd.
    * Fixed the ldap_url module, it will now raise Invalid_ldap_url
    when it fails to parse the url, instead of raising a generic
    exception such as Failure.
    * Fixed the regular expression for safe-string to actually detect
    non safe strings, which will be base64 encoded.
    * Fixed the encoding/decoding of substring filters, which did not
    perfectly follow the standard.
    * Fixed a bug in the filter grammar which would not allow multiple
    substring components
    * Fixed multiple bugs in the changerec parser and lexer
    * Added a new module, ldap_mutex, which implements mutexes in
    an ldap database using it's build in test and set mechanism. You
    can use this to implement advisory locking around various database
    operations such as the allocation of unique ids, and transactions.
    * Added documentation for the ldap_toplevel module, and improved
    the modify command.
2.1.2
    * fixed a bug in the encoding of substring filters, the
    length was not being computed correctly.
    * fixed a bug in diff, when syncing attributes it was not
    considering values which were not on the master, but were on
    the replica. This has been fixed.
    * added a dn parser and pretty printer which conforms to rfc 2253
    * added an exception Invalid_filter to the filter parser, it will
    raise this exception whenever there is an error. In addition to a
    string the exception contains an int, which indicates at which
    charachter the parser failed.
    * fixed a bug in the filter parser which allowed it to accept
    filters with garbage at the end.
    * exposed the escaping functions for attribute values in the dn
    parser, and the filter parser. These functions are intended to be
    used when you are manually manipulating stringified versions of
    the dn or filter via regular expressions or other means.
    * added some functions which are designed to be used from the
    toplevel for quick searches, and modifies. These are a work
    in progress.
2.1.1
   * Changed Lcstring to work like it used to, added a new module
     CaseInsensitiveString which does case preserving case insensitive
     comparisons.
2.1.0
   * ocaml-ssl is now required
   * BER Decoder
     - Improved decoding performance, 2x speedup. Beats OpenLDAP 2.2's
       decoder by about 5% (tested on PPC Mac OS 10.3, and Intel Linux)
     - Fixed decoding of negative integers
     - Fixed decoding of error codes to comply with rfc2251. Unknown error
       codes will now be returned as `OTHER according to the rfc.
     - Fixed buggy decoding of ldap controls. They were not well tested
       until now, and several misinterpertations of the standard existed.
     - Fixed a bug which only happens when controls are asserted, some
       operations with optional values at the end would fail to decode
       when the control was present because of improper boundry setting.
       Boundries are now set at the end of each operation.
   * BER Encoder
     - Fixed several bugs in the encoding of two's complement integers
       where the sign bit was not being handled correctly. This never
       effected ldap clients, but severly limited the functionality of ldap
       servers. They would be unable to respond to requests with message id
       128, which would cause most clients to hang
     - Fixed discrepancies between the ldap_errorcode variant type, and the
       type recognized by encode_ldapresultcode. They are not the same type,
       and no exception can be raised, the compiler will prove that client
       code doesn't send a variant which cannot be recognized.
   * ldap_funclient
     - Studied OpenLDAP's client library in depth, and adapted msgid
       allocation to look exactly like theirs. This will expose fewer
       bugs in ldap servers.
     - Changed the msgid type to an int32 (this should not be a visible
       change, it is an opaque type).
     - Refactored readbyte implementations, moved them to lber.ml, and
       tightened their exception handling.
   * ldap_ooclient
     - connect_timeout is now available as an optional argument to
       ldapcon.
     - added a method called "diff" to the ldapentry higharchy. It
       takes an entry and returns a list of differences between itself
       and the specified entry in the form of a modify record.
   * ldap_funserver
     - Deal with protocol errors according to rfc2251
     - Use the new readbyte implementations in lber.ml instead of a
       custom one
     - Implemented a logging harness. You pass in a function (optional) to
       init which takes a log level, and a string. The server will send your
       function log lines which exactly match the log format of OpenLDAP.
       The default function does nothing with the log lines. A parser for
       this log format is in the works and will be released as a seperate
       library.
   * LDIF Parser improvements
     - Improved the performance of write_entry, and to_string in Ldif_oo
     - Fixed a bug in the LDIF parser which could cause it to return
       the wrong line count when it finds a syntax error.
   * RFC 2252 schema parser/lexer
     - Fixed a typo in the lexer which would cause it
       not to correctly lex non numeric OIDs
     - Fixed bad lexing of X- attributes. There was an error in
       the definition of qdstring which would cause the lexer to eat
       all of the X- attributes in one pass. Tested fix
       with Active Directory 2003, OpenLDAP, and Novell eDirectory.
     - Changed the type of the attribute length field in the attribute
       record of the schema parser to be an Int64. The standard
       does not define the numeric range, and vendors
       (Novell) use huge numbers.
   * Schema Checker
     - Handled the case where the entry being checked does not have the
       objectclass attribute. Objectclass: top will be now be added in
       this case.
     - Fixed a bug in the "of_entry" method. It did not do a full schema
       check after importing the entry, so after calling of_entry the
       scldapentry was not proven to be valid.
   * Url Parser
     - Fixed a bug which could cause the url parser to return the wrong
       hostname if the hostname specified contained illegal characters.
   * Error Handling
     - moved err2string to a new module Ldap_error, which will contain
       functions for doing various things with LDAP_Failure exceptions.
       This WILL break existing applications which use err2string,
       however it is a simple matter of opening Ldap_error to fix them.
     - Implemented ldap_perror, and ldap_strerror functions, which
       either print, or return nicely formatted strings describing an
       LDAP_Failure exception.
2.0.3
   * Handle additional Unix_error exceptions as reconnection events,
     including EPIPE, ECONNRESET, and ECONNABORTED. Not handling these
     exceptions caused the library not to autoreconnect when the connection
     was dropped under certian circumstances.
2.0.2
   * Fixed a bug in the way delete was encoded which prevented it from working
2.0.1
   * Fixed a major bug in async calls.
2.0
   * Complete reimplementation of the low levels.
     - Pure Ocaml lber, and ldap protocol implementation. Ocamldap is
       no longer a C binding.
     - Server side as well as client side encoding/decoding
       functions. You can now make ldap servers with Ocamldap,
       as well as be a client!
     - No code optimization has been done yet, however the decoding
       performance is within 50% of the C library on the same hardware!
       Encoding performance has not been tested yet.
   * Some api changes to support additional error information, referrals
     and enhanced client side reliability. Minimal OO api changes,
     fairly significant lower level api changes
   * Module name reorganization. Painful, but it can only get worse
     if we let it stay the way it was. These two changes are the main
     reason for the 2.0 stamp.
   * Greatly simplified build system
   * All portions of the library are now covered by the LGPL license
1.6.5
   * added a configure script generated with autoconf which aids
     portability
1.6.4
   * Fixed a typo (DOH!) in ooldap which could cause crashes in some
     rare cases when the library is not used exactly as intended.
1.6.3
   * Fixed a subtle bug in transparent reconnections which would
     occurr if your ldap server did not come back up fast after
     the connection failed. It would cause
     LDAP_Failure `STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED to be raised for every
     operation after the server went down. There are still some bugs
     which I have not found. Spesifically, it is not a good idea to
     call unbind, and then use the object again. I've gotten libldap
     to die with an ascertion failure from doing this. However so far
     I can't identify the pattern. This isn't really a supported operation,
     and it has been very stable otherwise.
1.6.2
   * The new map, and search_s routines were not being tail call
     optimized in the byte code environment. This made doing long
     searches in the toplevel loop impossible.
   * added a new method to ldapentry and subclasses. modify. Useful
     in many ways. It takes a regular Ocamldap modify structure, so
     it can help with migration. I think the most useful thing about it
     is that the changes method outputs an Ocamldap modify structure,
     so you can sync changes between entries by calling changes, and
     then using modify to move them to another entry.
1.6.1
   * fixed a bug in the new code. was not checking the result of
     ldap_result, which resulted in an ascert failure when the
     connection was dropped. It is supposed to generate an exception.
1.6.0
   * reimplemented the glue code for search. The new code uses the
     async calls, and has some efficency problems removed. The
     low level api is broken in a small way by this, the type of entry
     has changed. attributes are now a list, instead of an array.
   * Added an async search call to the high level OO environment.
     search_a. It returns a function of type (unit -> ldapentry) which
     you can call to get your results. Also added iterator functions
     which are compatible with this new call. iter, map, rev_map, and
     fold. They take a (unit -> ldapentry) function, and a user supplied
     function and iterate just like the list operators. See the newly
     improved testoo.ml program.
   * Gutted the old build system and switched to OCamlMakefile for a
     better building experiance. Also, now actually build the glue code
     as a .so, so you don't need to build a custom toplevel in order to
     use ocamldap in it. Yaaaaah.
   * REMOVED the finalization function on ldapcon in the high level
     api.This was causing problems in that it would try to finalize the
     object whenever I returned a closure from one of it's methods. Caused
     many Bus Errors and Segfaults, took an hour with valgrind to actually
     figure out what was going on. found no work around, so. Release your
     ldap objects manually on pain of memory and fd leaks. sorry :(
   * Referrals are broken again! However, this is a step in the right
     direction, because I now have control over them. I'm going to be
     doing a lot of thinking about how to handle them. Right now
     if you have a referral in your directory you will get
     LDAP_Failure `LOCAL_ERROR at the end of your async search.
     You can just consider it success. This is what search_s does,
     all the iter functions will do it for you.
1.5.0
   * The library now depends on findlib, and ocamlnet. It will not
     compile without them.
   * added two new methods to ldapaccount service_exists, and
     services present, which allow the user to inspect what services
     are on an object.
   * Fixed a bug in ldapaccount. When computing whether it is possible
     to generate a dependancy of a generator it was not being taken
     into account whether the dependancy was allowed by the schema.
     ldapaccount, and scldapentry generally try to avoid adding
     objectclasses for you, because some attributes are allowed by
     so many objectclasses, and inference will pick the first one
     which allows the attribute. For things like "cn" you can end up
     with some very strange objectclasses on your objects. As a result
     attributes on which a generator is dependant, which could also
     be generated, but are not currently allowed, are no longer considered.
   * in the ldif parser added support for reading entries with base64
     values (Matthew Backes)
   * added a new method to ooldif, write_entry, which writes an
     entry to ldif with base64 support.
   * added two new methods to ooldif, to_string, and of_string to
     write an entry to an ldif string, and read an entry from an
     ldif string
   * added rudimentry support for referrals. Don't raise an exception
     when we get LDAP_REFERRAL back from ldap_search_s. It seems that
     openldap's libldap follows referrals transparently, which could be
     both good and bad. Either way, referrals will need futher invesigation.
1.4.6
   * fixed a bug in the ldif parser which prevented the last entry
     in an ldif file from being read.
   * fixed the ldif parser so that a file with just a dn is a valid
     ldif file.
   * added an unbind method to ldapcon, for explicit deallocation of
     sockets.
   * added a finalisation function to ldapcon which calls unbind.
     It IS safe to call unbind explicitly, the object will handle
     the case that it is unbound twice gracefully.
   * fixed a bug in delete service which could cause it not to delete
     all the attribute values that it should.
1.4.5
   * fixed a bug in transparent reconnections which would cause an
     infinite loop.
1.4.4
   * exposed an exception called "Cannot_sort_dependancies of string list"
   which indicates that circular dependancies have been detected among
   the attributes of the list. The exception will be raised when calling
   the generate method of an ldapaccount
1.4.3
   * changed the way the delta between an object and a service is computed.
   Instead of always doing a case sensitive match of the attribute values
   we now look up the matching rule in the schema and try to apply something
   close. We currently understand objectIdentifierMatch, caseIgnoreMatch, and
   caseExactIA5Match. I will probably add more later.
1.4.2
   * adds modrdn support in ooldap, which was horribly omitted previously
   * fixed a bug in the service code with respect to single valued
     attributes, and static service attributes. Previously, an object
     which needed to have a static attribute to satisfy a service would
     always get it be adding a second value. This won't work for single
     value attributes for obvious reasons. The fix is to check if the
     attribute is single valued, and if it is, replace it, otherwise, add it.
1.4.1
   * fixes a bug in the schema parser. X-.* attributes were not previously
     supported. 1.4.1 adds support for them.
1.4.0
   * added two new classes to the Ooldap module.
     - scldapentry understands the directory schema, and makes use of it
       in various ways. It is a subclass of ldapentry
     - ldapaccount is built on top of scldapentry. It understands the
       schema, and how to generate certian attributes (based on functions you
       give it). It also has a the ability to group attributes together into
       things it calls services, which can be added and removed atomically.
1.3.2
   * fixed massive memory leaks in the search C glue code
1.3.1
   * fixed some serious bugs in the C glue code which could cause
     the garbage collector to go nuts.
   * performance improvements in the way entry objects are arranged
     this will improve performance for searching, local modifications
     and the ldif parser. I haven't done another test, but the ldif
     parser spitting out entries is most likely just as fast as the
     engine (~26s for a 50MB ldif file on a PPC7450 800Mhz).
1.3.0
   * Added an rfc2252 schema parser, and an interface to grab schema's
     from the server, see ooldap.mli, the method schema. See
     schemaparser.ml for the structure of the record returned.
   * performance enhancements to the ldif parser, ~3x improvement in
     parseing speed. Native code can parse a 50MB ldif file in ~38 seconds,
     bytecode takes about 1m45s for the same file. Obviously different files
     yeild different results. There is further room for improvement in the
     building of the entry objects. The engine alone in native code parses
     the 50MB file in ~26 seconds, so the rest is the overhead of building the
     entry objects. All tests were performed on an 800Mhz G4.
   * Fixed a bug with update_entry which caused changes to be applied in
     reverse order. This often breaks the symantics when replace is involved.
1.2.0
   * Added support for transparently reconnecting to servers which
     have dropped the connection. Often servers will have an idle time out
     for connections. This is avaliable in the object oriented api only. It
     should create the illusion that the connection was never dropped. It
     can also be usefull in the case where one server in a failover cluster
     goes down. As long as something is there to take its place, the user
     of the api will never know that a server went down. This feature is
     experimental, but should work :). This is great for interactive
     sessions.
   * Added a standards compliant ldif parser. You can send it a
     stream of ldif, and by calling a method, get back an ldapentry
     object. See ooldif.mli for details. The known bugs are, its a bit
     slow, and it won't do anything with base64 encoded values. If you wish
     to decode them, do it yourself for now. Things of note, the
     parser is "picky" in that it tries to follow the rfc to the letter, it
     will generally not accept malformed ldif. Some users may consider that
     annoying, but we actually used it to find several errors in our
     directory server :), so it has advantages too.
   * Changed make dep to preprecess using cpp instead of camlp4o, due
     to strange undocumented changes in 3.07. I really need to look into
     this and fix it.
   * Changed the get_value method of ldapentry to raise Not_found
     instead of return the empty list when it is queried for an attribute
     which doesn't exist. Please complain if this annoys you.

1.1.2
    * Added a patch from Sylvain Le Gall to ease packaging for debian.
    * Added another patch from Sylvain Le Gall which adds support for
      making documentation with ocamldoc.

1.1.1
    * fixed the makefile to properly honor CFLAGS. This makes
      it possible to build on systems where the ldap libraries
      are in a nonstandard place
    * added findlib support. make install now installs a package
      called "ocamldap".

1.1.0
    * Eric Stokes has taken over maintanence of the project
    * added a new object oriented interface modeled after
      Net::LDAP in perl.
    * added an optional argument to init which allows
      selection of the protocal version. It defaults to 3.

1.0
    * added fixes from Eric Stokes:
    * added make dep to build dependencies
    * modified print_entry to print more ldif like output
     (it does not break up long lines correctly yet)

0.3.1
    * added fixes from Eric Stokes:
    * updated varcc with the latest version from labgtk
    * fixed ocamldap_tags.var to work with the new varcc
    * changed build scripts to allow compilation under 3.06
    * added ifdefs to remove kerberos support if not avaliable

0.3
    * added kerberos binding methods
    * added modrdn methods
    * most function arguments are lists now
    * fixed crash bug in search_s

0.2
    * add, modify, and delete are implemented
    * all ldap error codes are supported with the help of varcc
    * silly bugs fixed in bind and unbind

0.1
    * first Release by Miles Egan
    * only synchronous searches are supported
