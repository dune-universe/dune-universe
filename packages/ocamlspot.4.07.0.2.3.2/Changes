--------------

For OCaml 3.12.1.

ocamlspot:
- -i and --info options are now obsolete. Use ``ocamlspot info <filename>'' instead.
- --type-expand option is added for type-directed expansion of expressions and patterns. 
  Experimental.

ocamlspot.el:
- ocamlspot-path is removed. Use ocamlspot-command custom variable.
- ocamlspot-expand for type-directed expansion of expressions and patterns. Experimental.

Compiler modifications:
- If OCAML_ANNOT environment variable exists, ocamlc/ocamlopt create .annot, .spot 
  and .spit files even without -annot option.

1.2.0
--------------

- For OCaml 3.12.0
- Code cleanups

1.1
-----

Bug fix

- if x.spot file was obsolete, ocamlspot searched x.spit file instead, 
  which was not a correct behavior.
- exceptions in pattern were not browsable.
- ocamldoc recorded top structures.
- fix for predefined exception

New feature

- added -n option which does not analyze definition position.
- ocamlspot-type function is added for type query in ocamlspot.el
- ocamlspot-use function is added for use query in ocamlspot.el
- supports a new position format l<line>c<column in bytes> 
- supports a new query file:kind:path
- more spots are saved
- Work around for ocamlbuild. If .ocamlspot file with the text build_dir=dirname
  is placed in a directory $DIR, then spot files of source files under $DIR 
  ex. $DIR/subdir/source.ml is searched in $DIR/dirname/subdir/. See an example
  at camlp4/.ocamlspot


ocamlspot.el
* ocamlspot-path is now ocamlspot-command. Please fix your .emacs.
