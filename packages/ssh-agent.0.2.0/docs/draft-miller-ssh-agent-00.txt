1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote connections and
   login over untrusted networks.  It supports multiple authentication
   mechanisms, including public key authentication.  This document
   describes the protocol for interacting with an agent that holds
   private keys.  Clients (and possibly servers) can use invoke the
   agent via this protocol to perform operations using public and
   private keys held in the agent.

   Holding keys in an agent offers usability and security advantages to
   loading and unwrapping them at each use.  Moreover, the agent
   implements a simple protocol and presents a smaller attack surface
   than a key loaded into a full SSH server or client.

   This agent protocol is already widely used and a de-facto standard,
   having been implemented by a number of popular SSH clients and
   servers for many years.  The purpose of this document is to describe
   the protocol as it has been implemented.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Overview

   The agent protocol is a packetised request-response protocol, solely
   driven by the client.  It consists of a number of requests sent from
   the client to the server and a set of reply messages that are sent in
   response.  At no time does the server send messages except in
   response to a client request.  Replies are sent in order.

   All values in the agent protocol are encoded using the SSH wire
   representations specified by [RFC4251].  Messages consist of a length
   and contents.  The first byte of the contents always indicates the
   type of the message.

      uint32                   message length
      byte[message length]     message contents

4.  Protocol Messages

4.1.  Generic server responses

   The following generic messages may be sent by the server in response
   to requests from the client.  On success the agent may reply either
   with:

      byte                     SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS

   or a request-specific success message.  On failure, the agent may
   reply with:

      byte                     SSH_AGENT_FAILURE





Miller                  Expires November 25, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                   May 2016


   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE messages are also sent in reply to requests with
   unknown types.

4.2.  Adding keys to the agent

   Keys may be added to the agent using the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED messages.  The latter variant allows
   adding keys with optional constraints on their usage.

   The generic format for the key SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY message is:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY
       string                  key type
       byte[]                  key contents
       string                  key comment

   Here "type" is the specified key type name, for example "ssh-rsa" for
   a RSA key as defined by [RFC4253]. "contents" consists of the public
   and private components of the key and vary by key type, they are
   listed below for standard and commonly used key types. "comment" is
   an optional human-readable key name or comment as a UTF-8 string that
   may serve to identify the key in user-visible messages.

   The SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED is similar, but adds a extra field:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
       string                  type
       byte[]                  contents
       string                  comment
       constraint[]            constraints

   Constraints are used to place limits on the validity or use of keys.
   Section 4.2.6 details constraint types and their format.

   An agent should reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if the key was
   successfully loaded as a result of one of these messages, or
   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE otherwise.

4.2.1.  DSA keys

   DSA keys have key type "ssh-dss" and are defined in [RFC4253].  They
   may be added to the agent using the following message.  The
   "constraints" field is only present for the
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                               SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
       string                  "ssh-dss"
       mpint                   p
       mpint                   q
       mpint                   g
       mpint                   y
       mpint                   x
       string                  comment
       constraint[]            constraints

   The "p", "q", "g" values are the DSA domain parameters. "y" and "x"
   are the public and private keys respectively.  These values are as
   defined by [FIPS.186-4].

4.2.2.  ECDSA keys

   ECDSA keys have key types starting with "ecdsa-sha2-" and are defined
   in [RFC5656].  They may be added to the agent using the following
   message.  The "constraints" field is only present for the
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                               SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
       string                  key type
       string                  ecdsa_curve_name
       string                  Q
       mpint                   d
       string                  comment
       constraint[]            constraints

   The values "Q" and "d" are the ECDSA public and private values
   respectively.  Both are defined by [FIPS.186-4].

4.2.3.  ED25519 keys

   Ed25519 keys have key type "ssh-ed25519" and are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519].  They may be added to the agent using
   the following message.  The "key constraints" field is only present
   for the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                               SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
       string                  "ssh-ed25519"
       string                  ENC(A)
       string                  k || ENC(A)
       string                  comment
       constraint[]            constraints

   The first value is the 32 byte Ed25519 public key "ENC(A)".  The
   second value is a concatenation of the 32 byte private key "k" and 32
   byte public "ENC(A)" key.  The contents and interpretation of the
   "ENC(A)" and "k" values are defined by [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

4.2.4.  RSA keys

   RSA keys have key type "ssh-rsa" and are defined in [RFC4253].  They
   may be added to the agent using the following message.  The "key
   constraints" field is only present for the
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED message.

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY or
                               SSH_AGENTC_ADD_ID_CONSTRAINED
       string                  "ssh-rsa"
       mpint                   n
       mpint                   e
       mpint                   d
       mpint                   iqmp
       mpint                   p
       mpint                   q
       string                  comment
       constraint[]            constraints

   "n" is the public composite modulus.  "p" and "q" are its constituent
   private prime factors. "e" is the public exponent.  "iqmp" is the
   inverse of "q" modulo "p".  All these values except "iqmp" (which can
   be calculated from the others) are defined by [FIPS.186-4].

4.2.5.  Adding keys from a token

   Keys hosted on smart-cards or other hardware tokens may be added
   using the SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY and
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED requests.  Note that
   "constraints" field is only included for the
   SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED variant of this message.

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY or
                               SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED
       string                  id
       string                  PIN
       constraint[]            constraints

   Here "id" is an opaque identifier for the hardware token and "PIN" is
   an optional password on PIN to unlock the key.  The interpretation of
   "id" is not defined by the protocol but is left solely up to the
   agent.

   Typically only the public components of any keys supported on a
   hardware token will be loaded into an agent so, strictly speaking,
   this message really arranges future private key operations to be
   delegated to the hardware token in question.

   An agent should reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if one or more keys were
   successfully loaded as a result of one of these messages, or
   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if no keys were found.  The agent should also
   return SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if the token "id" was not recognised or if
   the agent doesn't support token-hosted keys at all.

4.2.6.  Key Constraints

   A number of constraints and may be used in the constrained variants
   of the key add messages.  Each constraint is represented by a type
   byte followed by zero or more value bytes.

   Zero or more constraints may be specified when adding a key with one
   of the *_CONSTRAINED requests.  Multiple constraints are appended
   consecutively to the end of the request:

       byte                    constraint1_type
       byte[]                  constraint1_data
       byte                    constraint2_type
       byte[]                  constraint2_data
       ....
       byte                    constraintN_type
       byte[]                  constraintN_data

   If an agent does not recognise or support a requested constraint it
   MUST refuse the request and return a SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message to the
   client.

   The following constraints are defined.

4.2.6.1.  Key lifetime constraint

   This constraint requests that the agent limit the key's lifetime by
   deleting it after the specified duration (in seconds) has elapsed
   from the time the key was added to the agent.

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_LIFETIME
       uint32                  seconds

4.2.6.2.  Key confirmation constraint

   This constraint requests that the agent require explicit user
   confirmation for each private key operation using the key.  For
   example, the agent could present a confirmation dialog before
   completing a signature operation.

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_CONFIRM

4.2.6.3.  Constraint extensions

   Agents may implement experimental or private-use constraints through
   a extension constraint that supports named constraints.

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_EXTENSION
       string                  extension name
       byte[]                  extension-specific details

   The extension name MUST consist of a UTF-8 string suffixed by the
   implementation domain following the naming scheme defined in
   Section 4.2 of [RFC4251], e.g.  "foo@example.com".

4.3.  Removing keys from the agent

   A client may request that an agent remove all keys that it stores:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_ALL_IDENTITIES

   On receipt of such a message, an agent shall delete all keys that it
   is holding and reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS.

   Specific keys may also be removed:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_IDENTITY
       string                  key blob

   Where "key blob" is the standard public key encoding of the key to be
   removed.  SSH protocol key encodings are defined in [RFC4253] for
   "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss" keys, in [RFC5656] for "ecdsa-sha2-*" keys
   and in [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519] for "ssh-ed25519" keys.

   An agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if the key was deleted or
   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if it was not found.

   Smartcard keys may be removed using:

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                   May 2016


       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_REMOVE_SMARTCARD_KEY
       string                  reader id
       string                  PIN

   Where "reader id" is an opaque identifier for the smartcard reader
   and "PIN" is an optional password or PIN (not typically used).
   Requesting deletion of smartcard-hosted keys will cause the agent to
   remove all keys loaded from that smartcard.

   An agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if the key was deleted or
   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE if it was not found.

4.4.  Requesting a list of keys

   A client may request a list of keys from an agent using the following
   message:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_REQUEST_IDENTITIES

   The agent shall reply with a message with the following preamble.

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_IDENTITIES_ANSWER
       uint32                  nkeys

   Where "nkeys" indicates the number of keys to follow.  Following the
   preamble are zero or more keys, each encoded as:

       string                  key blob
       string                  comment

   Where "key blob" is the wire encoding of the public key and "comment"
   is a human-readable comment encoded as a UTF-8 string.

4.5.  Private key operations

   A client may request the agent perform a private key signature
   operation using the following message:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST
       string                  key blob
       string                  data
       uint32                  flags

   Where "key blob" is the key requested to perform the signature,
   "data" is the data to be signed and "flags" is a bitfield containing
   the bitwise OR of zero or more signature flags (see below).

   If the agent is unable or unwilling to generate the signature (e.g.
   because it doesn't have the specified key, or the user refused
   confirmation of a constrained key), it must reply with a
   SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message.

   On success, the agent shall reply with:

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE
       string                  signature

   The signature format is specific to the algorithm of the key type in
   use.  SSH protocol signature formats are defined in [RFC4253] for
   "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss" keys, in [RFC5656] for "ecdsa-sha2-*" keys
   and in [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519] for "ssh-ed25519" keys.

4.5.1.  Signature flags

   Two flags are currently defined for signature request messages:
   SSH_AGENT_RSA_SHA2_256 and SSH_AGENT_RSA_SHA2_512.  These two flags
   are only valid for "ssh-rsa" keys and request that the agent return a
   signature using the "rsa-sha2-256" or "rsa-sha2-515" signature
   methods respectively.  These signature schemes are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-curdle-rsa-sha2].

4.6.  Locking and unlocking an agent

   The agent protocol supports requesting that an agent temporarily lock
   itself with a pass-phrase.  When locked an agent should suspend
   processing of sensitive operations (private key operations at the
   very least) until it has been unlocked with the same pass-phrase.

   The following message requests agent locking

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_LOCK
       string                  passphrase

   The agent shall reply with SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS if locked successfully
   or SSH_AGENT_FAILURE otherwise (e.g. if the agent was already
   locked).

   The following message requests unlocking an agent:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_UNLOCK
       string                  passphrase

   If the agent is already locked and the pass-phrase matches the one
   used to lock it then it should unlock and reply with
   SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS.  If the agent is unlocked or if the the pass-

   phrase does not match it should reply with SSH_AGENT_FAILURE.  An
   agent SHOULD take countermeasures against brute-force guessing
   attacks against the pass-phrase.

4.7.  Extension mechanism

   The agent protocol includes an optional extension mechanism that
   allows vendor-specific and experimental messages to be sent via the
   agent protocol.  Extension requests from the client consist of:

       byte                    SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION
       string                  extension type
       byte[]                  extension contents

   The extension type indicates the type of the extension message as a
   UTF-8 string.  Implementation-specific extensions should be suffixed
   by the implementation domain following the extension naming scheme
   defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC4251], e.g.  "foo@example.com".

   An agent that does not support extensions of the supplied type MUST
   reply with an empty SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message.  This reply is also
   sent by agents that do not support the extension mechanism at all.

   The contents of successful extension reply messages are specific to
   the extension type.  Extension requests may return SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
   on success or some other extension-specific message.

   Extension failure should be signaled using the
   SSH_AGENT_EXTENSION_FAILURE code - extensions should not use the
   standard SSH_AGENT_FAILURE message.  This allows failed requests to
   be distinguished from the extension not being supported.

4.7.1.  Query extension

   A single, optional extension request "query" is defined to allow a
   client to query which, if any, extensions are supported by an agent.

   If an agent supports the "query" extension is should reply with a
   list of supported extension names.

       byte                    SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS
       string[]                extension type

6.  Acknowledgements

   This protocol was designed and first implemented by Markus Friedl,
   based on a similar protocol for an agent to support the legacy SSH
   version 1 by Tatu Ylonen.

   Thanks to Simon Tatham who reviewed and helped improve this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This protocol requires three registries be established, one for
   message numbers, one for constraints and one for signature request
   flags.

7.1.  New registry: SSH agent protocol numbers

   This registry, titled "SSH agent protocol numbers" records the
   message numbers for client requests and agent responses.  Its initial
   state should consist of the following numbers and reservations.
   Future message number allocations shall require specification in the
   form of an RFC (RFC REQUIRED as per [RFC5226]).

8.  Security Considerations

   The agent is a service that is tasked with retaining and providing
   controlled access to what are typically long-lived login
   authentication credentials.  It is by nature a sensitive and trusted
   software component.  Moreover, the agent protocol itself does not
   include any authentication or transport security; ability to
   communicate with an agent is usually sufficient to invoke it to
   perform private key operations.

   Since being able to access an agent is usually sufficient to perform
   private key operations, it is critically important that the agent
   only be exposed to its owner.

   The primary design intention of an agent is that an attacker with
   unprivileged access to their victim's agent should be prevented from
   gaining a copy of any keys that have been loaded in to it.  This may
   not preclude the attacker from stealing use of those keys (e.g. if
   they have been loaded without a confirmation constraint).

   Given this, the agent should, as far as possible, prevent its memory
   being read by other processes to direct theft of loaded keys.  This
   typically include disabling debugging interfaces and preventing
   process memory dumps on abnormal termination.

   Another, more subtle, means by which keys may be stolen are via
   cryptographic side-channels.  Private key operations may leak
   information about the contents of keys via differences in timing,
   power use or by side-effects in the memory subsystems (e.g.  CPU

   caches) of the host running the agent.  For the case of a local
   attacker and an agent holding unconstrained keys, the only limit on
   the number of private key operations the attacker may be able to
   observe is the rate at which the CPU can perform signatures.  This
   grants the attacker an almost ideal oracle for side-channel attacks.
   While a full treatment of side-channel attacks is beyond the scope of
   this specification, agents SHOULD use cryptographic implementations
   that are resistant to side-channel attacks.
