USE ZARITH for DECIMAL type,
OR Core.BIGNUM for the core branch and switch to use of dune for core branch

DO NOT DO THIS:
Actually copy the Utilities file.
And copy all the required types only found in this project at preset, such as uint64_w_sexp.ml, etc, and perhaps others soon to join them.

Look at no core branch and replicate:
creating a toplevel ml file that contains all the generated modules in src/tables - DONE
support complex types as field types...at some point in the future.

Support dune: write dune file into src/tables - DONE

Write ALL the extended module types into the generated modules -- think its DONE
Use string not Core.String even in core branch for compatability with some ppx rewriters - DONE

DO NOT DO THIS:
Copy not just utilities2copy but also all the extended modules into src/tables/extendedtypes and create an extendedtypes.ml file to bundle them.

Use the extended types ... still writing Core.Date.t instead of Date_extended.t - partly done
