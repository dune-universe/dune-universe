# prettiest

Implementation of Jean-Philippe Bernardy's [A Pretty But Not Greedy Printer (Functional Pearl). PACMPL 1(ICFP): 6:1-6:21 (2017)](https://jyp.github.io/pdf/Prettiest.pdf) in OCaml.
The author of the paper has a [version in Haskell](https://github.com/jyp/prettiest).

I make no promises about performance.
