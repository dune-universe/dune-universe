synopsis: "Not Another Compiler Compiler"
description: """

    nacc, short for "Not a Compiler Compiler" or alternatively "Not Another Compiler Compiler" is a homemade parser combinator, as inspired from Computerphile's video on Functional Parsing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDtZLm7HIJs).

    nacc strives to be simple yet monadic, allowing any context-free grammar to be safely parsed with this library. The library provides utility functions and operators to ease the writing of combinator parsers."""
