        * Fixed warning switches for OCaml 4.03.0

        * pkg-config is now used if exists in order to seek external libraries

4.1.0
        * bmp was not linked with examples. Since bmp is pure ML libarary, 
          you may need to add -linkall to linker command to your build script,
          otherwise the module is silently ignored. 
        * bmp 32bit RGBA is now supported
        * added jpeg marker load/saving (not tested well)
        * added exif support (you need libexif)
        ! refactored ocamlfind package names (probably introduce some incompatibility)
        * removed unused old configure and make scripts
        * Applied GODI's patches. Now omake takes the following variable definitions:
             - INCLUDES
             - LDFLAGS
             - NATIVE_ENABLED
             - ARG_WANT_XXX
             - ARG_PATH_GS
             - ARG_FREETYPE_CONFIG
          If they are not defined, some default values are deduced.
