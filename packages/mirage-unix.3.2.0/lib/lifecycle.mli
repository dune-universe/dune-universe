(** [await_shutdown_request ()] is thread that resolves when the domain is
    asked to shut down.
    The optional [poweroff] (default:[true]) and [reboot] (default:[false])
    arguments can be used to indicate which features the caller wants to
    advertise (however, you can still get a request for a mode you didn't claim
    to support). *)
