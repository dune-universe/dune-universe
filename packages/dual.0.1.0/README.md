Dual Numbers Library
====================

This repository contains a dual number implemention in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org).  It hasn't been super well tested as I haven't used
it extensively and hence the 0.1.0 designation.  There isn't much to it however
and outside of typos it should function as intended.  Please submit issues if
you find a bug.

If you have no idea what dual numbers are I've provided a brief
[introduction](https://github.com/drjdn/ocaml_dual/blob/master/dual_numbers.pdf).

Installation
------------

As long as you have a recent version of [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) you
can install as follows:
```bash
$ opam install dual
```
