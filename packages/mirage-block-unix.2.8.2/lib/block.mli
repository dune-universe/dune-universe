(** [connect ?buffered ?sync path] connects to a block device on the filesystem
    at [path]. By default I/O is buffered and asynchronous. These defaults
    can be changed by supplying the optional arguments [~buffered:false] and
    [~sync:false] *)

val resize : t -> int64 -> (unit, write_error) result io
(** [resize t new_size_sectors] attempts to resize the connected device
    to have the given number of sectors. If successful, subsequent calls
    to [get_info] will reflect the new size. *)

(** [flush t] flushes any buffers, if the file has been opened in buffered
    mode *)

(** [seek_unmapped t start] returns the sector offset of the next guaranteed
    zero-filled region (typically guaranteed because it is unmapped) *)

val seek_mapped: t -> int64 -> (int64, error) result io
(** [seek_mapped t start] returns the sector offset of the next regoin of the
    device which may have data in it (typically this is the next mapped
    region) *)

(** [to_config t] returns the configuration of a device *)

(** [of_config config] creates a fresh device from [config] *)
